## Project Approach and Assumptions

### Approach

1. **Project Setup:**
   - Used Spring Boot for backend development.
   - Implemented RESTful API to handle user registration, authentication, and task management.
   - Applied JWT for stateless authentication.
   - Configured Spring Security to secure API endpoints.

2. **Data Management:**
   - Utilized an SQL database for storing user and task data.
   - Designed the database schema to include users and tasks with relationships.

3. **API Documentation:**
   - Used Swagger for generating interactive API documentation.
   - Provided Postman collection for testing and interacting with the API.

4. **Dockerization:**
   - Created a Dockerfile to containerize the application.
   - Provided a `docker-compose.yml` file for setting up the application and database.

### Assumptions

1. **Authentication:**
   - Users will authenticate using JWT tokens, which are required for accessing most endpoints.

2. **Stateless API:**
   - The API is stateless, meaning sessions are not used to maintain state on the server.

3. **Security:**
   - CSRF protection is disabled for simplicity, as this is a stateless API.

4. **Error Handling:**
   - Basic error handling is implemented; more detailed error handling can be added as needed.

5. **Environment:**
   - The application is assumed to be run locally or in a containerized environment.
